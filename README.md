# Anime Haven

Build a premium modern anime streaming website using Node.js as the backend.



The website must be focused only on anime discovery and anime watching.



1. Technology Stack



Use:



- Node.js

- Express.js

- HTML5

- CSS3

- Modern JavaScript

- TMDB API

- Inter font

- SVG icons



Use a clean and scalable project structure.



The website must have a proper Node.js backend so all TMDB API requests are handled securely through the server.



---



2. TMDB API



Use the TMDB API for anime metadata.



TMDB API base URL:



https://api.themoviedb.org/3



Image base URL:



https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/



Use TMDB for:



- Anime posters

- Backdrops

- Titles

- Original titles

- Overview/description

- Ratings

- Genres

- Release dates

- Trending anime

- Popular anime

- Top-rated anime

- Search results

- Seasons

- Episodes metadata

- Cast

- Crew

- Character names

- Cast profile photos

- Related/recommended anime

- Production information



Use the TMDB API key supplied by the project owner, but NEVER expose the key in frontend JavaScript, HTML, CSS, browser requests, GitHub, or public source files.



Store it only inside:



".env"



Example:



TMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY



The frontend must communicate with the Node.js backend, and the Node.js backend communicates with TMDB.



Never make requests such as:



"https://api.themoviedb.org/3/...?...api_key=SECRET_KEY"



directly from the browser.



Instead create backend routes such as:



"/api/trending"



"/api/popular"



"/api/top-rated"



"/api/search"



"/api/anime/:id"



"/api/anime/:id/credits"



"/api/anime/:id/recommendations"



"/api/anime/:id/seasons"



The API key must remain completely server-side.

3. Logo



Use the provided project logo image:



https://imgh.in/host/gvq4wb



Use this logo in:



- Navbar

- Mobile navigation

- Loading screen where appropriate

- Login/profile areas if created later



Do not replace the provided logo with a random generated logo.



---



4. Design Direction

The design should feel like a dedicated anime streaming platform.



Use:



- Dark cinematic theme

- Glassmorphism where appropriate

- Smooth transitions

- High-quality cards

- Large cinematic hero section

- Modern navigation

- Micro-interactions

- Hover animations

- Smooth page transitions

- Skeleton loading

- Mobile-first design



The interface should feel polished and production-ready.



---



5. Font



Use Inter everywhere.



Do NOT use:



- Arial

- system-ui

- "-apple-system"

- browser default system fonts

- Episodes metadata

- Cast

Make the UI ready to migrate to a real database later.



---



20. LOADING SYSTEM



Create beautiful loading states.



Use:

- Desktop monitors



Mobile layout should not simply be a scaled-down desktop layout.

24. BACKEND API STRUCTURE



Create Node.js/Express API routes similar to:



GET "/api/trending"



GET "/api/popular"



GET "/api/top-rated"



GET "/api/search?q=anime"



GET "/api/anime/:id"



GET "/api/anime/:id/credits"



GET "/api/anime/:id/recommendations"



GET "/api/anime/:id/seasons"

The backend should handle TMDB requests and return clean JSON to the frontend.



---



25. SECURITY



Implement:



- ".env"

- ".gitignore"

- Server-side API key

- Request validation

- Rate limiting

- Proper CORS configuration

- Safe error responses

- No secret information in frontend source

- No API key in HTML

/js

/assets



.env



.gitignore



package.json

Keep backend and frontend responsibilities separate.



---



27. IMPORTANT CURRENT LIMITATION



This version should NOT include the actual anime streaming player.



The Watch button and episode buttons can currently open a temporary "Player Coming Soon" interface.



Build the entire UI and metadata experience now so the real player can be integrated later without redesigning the website.



---



28. FINAL QUALITY REQUIREMENT



The final website should feel like a real premium anime streaming platform, not a basic HTML project.



Prioritize:



- Modern UI

- High-quality animations

- Smooth interactions

- Fast loading

- Secure Node.js backend

- Proper TMDB integration

- Dynamic anime data

- Cast and crew photos

- Season switching

- Responsive design

- Inter typography

- Cinematic anime artwork



Every tab must work.



Every anime card must open its corresponding anime information.



Every anime detail page must dynamically load available TMDB information.



Season switching must work with smooth animation.



The video player should intentionally remain disabled for this version and be implemented later.
